# 3.	Write a Python program to find the area of a triangle ?

# The formula to calculate the area of triangle:
# area = (base * height)/2

# taking input from user:
base = float(input("Enter the length of base: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height of base: "))

# caluculating the area
area = (base * height)/2

# printing the value
print(f"The area of Triangle is:{area}")
